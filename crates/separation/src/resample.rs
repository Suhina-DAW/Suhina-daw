//! Resampling between a source's rate and a model's (docs/spec/stem-separation.md › Resampling):
//! band-limited interpolation with a Blackman-windowed sinc, read from a table of the kernel at
//! `PHASES` points per input frame with linear interpolation between them.
//!
//! The output frame `j` sits at input position `j × from / to`, computed in integers, so the
//! positions never drift and a run is the same on every call. The cut-off is a little below the
//! lower of the two Nyquist frequencies, so nothing folds back when going down; going up, the
//! signal stays as it was below the old Nyquist frequency.
